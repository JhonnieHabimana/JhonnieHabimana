# üëã Hi, I'm Jhonie Berise Habimana

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **Junior Data Engineer** with a background in **Biomedical Engineering** and a deep passion for leveraging data to drive meaningful decisions. I thrive at the intersection of healthcare and technology, and I‚Äôm particularly interested in building tools and pipelines that transform complex data into clear, actionable insights.

## üéì Academic Background
I recently completed my MSc in Biomedical Engineering, where I focused on combining engineering principles with data science to solve real-world challenges. My thesis, **"Using Machine Learning to Automate Signal Quality Control for Large Time-Series Datasets"**, involved developing classification models and tools to streamline the validation of biomedical sensor data ‚Äî a key step in improving data integrity at scale.

## üíº Industry Experience
During my 8-month internship at the **Insight SFI Centre for Data Analytics**, I worked on a wide range of data engineering tasks, including:
- Designing and deploying **ETL pipelines** using Python and SQL
- Building a fully functional **Signal Quality Control (SQC) GUI Tool** from scratch using Python
- Processing and analyzing **large time-series datasets**
- Utilizing **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** for data storage and processing
- Collaborating cross-functionally with software engineers and research teams to deliver scalable solutions

This hands-on experience sharpened my technical skills and solidified my commitment to a career in data engineering and analytics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Proficiencies
- **Languages & Tools**: Python, MATLAB, SQL, Git, GitHub, Bash
- **Cloud Platforms**: Google Cloud Platform (BigQuery, Storage, Compute)
- **Data Tools**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Tableau, Power BI
- **Workflow & Pipelines**: ETL Design, Data Cleaning, Data Transformation
- **Areas of Interest**: Time-Series Analysis, ML for Signal Processing, Healthcare Data, Statistical Quality Control

## üì´ Let‚Äôs Connect
I'm actively seeking opportunities where I can continue growing as a data engineer and contribute to impactful, data-driven projects. Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out via LinkedIn or email if you'd like to connect.

Thanks for stopping by!
